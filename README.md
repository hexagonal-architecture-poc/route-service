## How to use

To access the standalone access: 
- Less time between city 1 and city 3: [http://localhost:8081/routes/less-time?origin=1&destiny=3](http://localhost:8081/routes/less-time?origin=1&destiny=3)

    ```json

## Frameworks

- **SpringBoot(2.0):** Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone applications. The Spring container provides an implementation for IoC supporting Dependency Injection.
- **SpringBoot Actuator:** SpringBootâ€™s Actuator which provides production ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.
	- This solution uses the health endpoint to check if the application is ready when deploying on kubernetes. (readinessProbe and livenessProbe)
- **SpringBoot devtools:** Includes a set of tools to make the development experience easier. For example, Automatic Restart. When the application is launched with 'java -jar' all developer tools are disabled.
- **Sleuth:** Implements a distributed tracing solution.
	- Sleuth was used to easily track logs from different microservices.
	- With Zipkin, it's possible to track every microservice call. 
- **Swagger:** Creates a dynamic documentation for controllers.
	- Used to create a API documentation.
- **OpenFeign:** Makes writing java HTTP clients easier.
    - Used to create a HTTP client for itinerary-service.
